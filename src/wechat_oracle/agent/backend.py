"""Agent backend abstraction: native (in-process Phase A/B + tools) vs
openclaw (delegates the entire agent loop to a local OpenClaw gateway running
a wechat-bot agent).

Why two backends: OpenClaw lets the bot use a Claude subscription (Pro/Max)
instead of paying per-token API rates — for a chatty group bot this is a
significant cost difference, and the real reason openclaw is the recommended
backend. Native is kept as fallback / A-B reference / for users who don't
want to install OpenClaw.

The protocol intentionally takes `CommandContext` directly rather than a
shrunken DTO — every field on CommandContext is already needed by
`chat_via_agent` and copying them just to flatten the shape adds churn for
zero readability gain.

Lurk path (`chat_via_lurk`) remains a separate dispatcher idle-loop entry, but
it also delegates to OpenClaw when `WO_AGENT_BACKEND=openclaw` so background
reflection uses the same subscription-backed route as chat.
